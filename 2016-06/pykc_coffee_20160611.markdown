## PythonKC News

### PythonKC Organizer Search
* Python expertise is _not_ a requirement
    * Oraganizer tasks have almost _nothing_ to do with Python skills
    * Finding meeting space and lining up presentations don't require writing code
* Being an organizer is _not_ a huge time commitment
    * Mostly it's just _showing up_
    * No current organizer is stepping down
* We'd like to represent differing points-of-view
    * Take a look at the current PythonKC organizers
    * We're more alike than different
    * We'd like to change that
